//Go is very similar to C due to presence of pointers, static typing and many other things. But Go is a modern language and so it has many new features baked in it.One notable feature is receiver functions.
//Receiver functions of structs for interface method implementation. With receiver functions you donâ€™t have to mess around with classes or deal with inheritance
